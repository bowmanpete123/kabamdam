# Agentic Workflow Rules

## Workflow Process
You must follow the strict sequence defined in the [Implement Task](../workflows/implement_task.md) workflow:

1. **[Project Manager](../roles/project_manager.md)**: Setup, Task Source, & Scripts.
2. **[Architect](../roles/architect.md)**: Decomposition & Technical Design.
3. **[Product Owner](../roles/product_owner.md)**: Vision & Roadmap Management.
4. **[Business Analyst](../roles/business_analyst.md)**: Behavioral Requirements & Scenarios.
5. **[Test Engineer](../roles/test_engineer.md)**: TDD Test Planning (pytest-kedge).
6. **[Developer](../roles/developer.md)**: Implementation.
7. **[Code Reviewer](../roles/code_reviewer.md)**: Quality Assurance & Merge.

**Do not deviate from this sequence.**

## Workflow
1. Read the role file for your current task.
2. Follow the permissions defined in the role.
3. Track all progress in `task.md`.
